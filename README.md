Made for both creating a personal resume/portfolio sight and for DALI lab coding challenge.

I have once tried to make a website using WordPress as a base, however, I found myself completely unfamiliar with HTML, CSS and PHP. Though I made something somewhat functional, I ended up far more frustrated with myself and web design as field. This time I wanted to give it another try and after looking at 3 portfolio websites, I felt inspired.

This site is a one pager, with the intention for my project links to connect to either a more detailed blog-style page or towards a blog post. But for now will simply feature thumbnails, a short description and a link to either their repository or ShaderToy link.

Special thanks to the incredible people that made the websites I was inspired by and learned from.
