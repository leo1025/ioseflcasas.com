Made for both creating a personal resume/portfolio sight and for DALI lab coding Coding.

I have once tried to make a website using WordPress as a base, however, I found myself completely unfamiliar with HTML, CSS and PHP. And though I made something somewhat functional, I ended up far more frustrated with myself and web design. This time I wanted to give it another try and after looking at 3 portfolio websites, I felt inspired.

This sight is mostly a one pager, with the intention for my work links to connect to either a more detailed html page or towards a blog post. But for now will simply feature thumbnails and a short description.

Special thanks to the incredible people that made the websites I was inspired by and my sister. Who helped me design my website.
