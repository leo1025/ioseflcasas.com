Remake of original one-pager resume website. You can still find the old versions under previous commits.

There were many problems with the previous website, that after some time became painfully apparent.
- Poor scaling elements.
- 0 responsiveness to smaller devices.
- Gawdy design for a resume.
- Not easily digestible due to massive size of elements.

Therefore, I've gone to redesign the entire website. You can find the wireframes, web-links and design documents in the **docs** folder.

### Beta v.1.0.1
- Added responsive homepage with collapsable top navigation and general information.
- Link funcitonality to old resume site from **Resume** navigation link.
- Incomplete links go to default "Under Construction" page.

### Beta v.1.0.2
- New on-view title that slowly fades in upon loading the homepage. 
- Fixed scaling and collapsing bugs on top-navigation bar. 
- Resume page has been given base CSS
- Externalized the top-navigation CSS to be a modular component that can now be attached onto any page.
