# Resume Page Design

## Sectioning

The resume site will be split into 4 main sections. The profile section, skills section, work section, and contact section. All accessable from the top bar, that 
will navigate the user up and down the page.

The sections will have alternating background colors. And bright color for the title sections.

- All elements will be compressed into a thin column that does not scale with screen size. Meaning a smaller screen will be zoomed in rather than rescaled.


### Profile

The Profile section will have my profile picture on the left and basic information on the right on the first row. Padded on top to make it the center piece upon opening the page.

The second row will be the introductory paragraph. Fitted and styled to be quickl readable.

The profile picture should have an easy to see outline, and scalable to the screen.

The text should also be scalable to screensize.

### Skills

The skills section should be a linear easy to read long list. Equally sized to the rest of the site. The text should not scale, but should be made less bold and popping. 

The skills should be marked by blocks, that are sectioned off and give easy to understand skill proficiency.

They should animate, where upon being visible, should fill up to their appropriate widths.

All skills should be doubled checked and listed, as all possible skills will be important. 

### Work

This section will have only two items within it, that will need to be changed continuously. 

These will be noted by two titles, "Ongoing" and "Recent", displaying the current ongoing project that I am working on (As relating to Software Engineering) and the most recent one completed. 

The projects should be split into 25% and 75% column structure. The picture, with a on-hover overlay should cover 25% of the available space. The title and description should be on the otherside in the 75% width area. 

These should all link to the respected github page of the project. 

There should be a button at the bottom, that will link to the portfolio page. Once it is completed. 

### Contact

This should be a simple contact section, small with radial buttons that open direct email or linkedin pages. And their respective information of the right of them. 

There should also be a note and link to the contact page form once it is completed. 

At the very bottom should be a short disclaimer about the purpose of the page and the information presented. As well as multiple links to other parts of the website.

#### Overall

The design should follow the rest of the site, with slight modifications to make it more digestable.

- Eventually it will need some sort of database crawling feature from the portfolio page. Able to automatically load the Most Recent and Ongoing projects from that database. 

- It should also eventually some with a "Introduction" feature, that will have myself guiding viewers though my resume.

- There should eventually be a "Experience" Section, that will need to be added as I start working at other places.
