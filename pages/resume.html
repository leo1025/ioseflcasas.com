        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
        <p>I'm currently remaking my entire website, transforming it into a massive repository and catalog of my work, passions and thoughts. I'll be expanding it to multiple pages, including a home page, resume page, detailed about page and a contact page. There are many other pages that I plan to make, but currently these are the most important. This a very important project, as it will become a place to point people to. Be they employers, buisness partners, colleagues, friends or students that I'm helping.</p>

        <h3>Ray Tracing but in ShaderToy</h3>
        <p>Following the books by Peter Shirley: Ray-Tracing in One Weekend and Ray-Tracing: The Next Week, I implemented a Ray-Tracer in ShaderToy. Also being a retry of the CS77 Assignment that was a real time ray-tracer that proved to be poor at rendering. The second book had me doing a lot of work arounds, abandoning my real-time ray-tracing attempt in favor of a static image render and constant resampling of the frames to create incredibly crisp images (Including the image that is featured on the top of this site). I ended up realizing that my code was poorly structured, and needed to fork a similar ray-tracer and reference it to rebuild my Ray-Tracer. Despite the spectular results, I learned that there is a lot for me to learn. I felt that this dive into Ray-Tracing was a stepping stone to go further into Computer Graphics.</p>
